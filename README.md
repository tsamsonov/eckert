# eckert

`eckert` is a Rust library that implements cartographic generalization algorithms. It is named after renowned German cartographer [Max Eckert](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Max_Eckert-Greifendorff) (1868-1938) who made a defining contribution to establishing Cartography as an academic field. He was also the first who explicitly identified *generalization* as a specific process essential for mapmaking.
